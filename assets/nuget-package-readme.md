## Overview

The `IAsyncEnumerable` interface was added to .NET in `.NET Core 3.0` and is part of `.NET Standard 2.1`. The main use-case was for iterative asynchronous enumeration over some resource. For instance, an event stream or a REST API interface with pagination, asynchronous reading over a list of files and accumulating the results, where each action can be modeled as a [`MoveNextAsync`][4] call on the [`IAsyncEnumerator<'T>`][5] given by a call to [`GetAsyncEnumerator()`][6].

Since the introduction of `task` in F# the call for a native implementation of _task sequences_ has grown, in particular because proper iterating over an `IAsyncEnumerable` has proven challenging, especially if one wants to avoid mutable variables. This library is an answer to that call and implements the same _resumable state machine_ approach with `taskSeq`.

### Module functions

As with `seq` and `Seq`, this library comes with a bunch of well-known collection functions, like `TaskSeq.empty`, `isEmpty` or `TaskSeq.map`, `iter`, `collect`, `fold` and `TaskSeq.find`, `pick`, `choose`, `filter`. Where applicable, these come with async variants, like `TaskSeq.mapAsync` `iterAsync`, `collectAsync`, `foldAsync` and `TaskSeq.findAsync`, `pickAsync`, `chooseAsync`, `filterAsync`, which allows the applied function to be asynchronous.

[See below](#taskseq-module-functions) for a full list of currently implemented functions and their variants.

### `taskSeq` computation expressions

The `taskSeq` computation expression can be used just like using `seq`. On top of that, it adds support for working with tasks through `let!` and
looping over a normal or asynchronous sequence (one that implements `IAsyncEnumerable<'T>'`). You can use `yield!` and `yield` and there's support
for `use` and `use!`, `try-with` and `try-finally` and `while` loops within the task sequence expression.

### Examples

```f#
open System.IO

open FSharp.Control

// singleton is fine
let hello = taskSeq { yield "Hello, World!" }

// can be mixed with normal sequences
let oneToTen = taskSeq { yield! [1..10] }

// returns a delayed sequence of IAsyncEnumerable<string>
let allFilesAsLines() = taskSeq {
    let files = Directory.EnumerateFiles(@"c:\temp")
    for file in files do
        // await
        let! contents = File.ReadAllLinesAsync file
        // return all lines
        yield! contents
}

let write file = 
    allFilesAsLines()
    
    // synchronous map function on asynchronous task sequence
    |> TaskSeq.map (fun x -> x.Replace("a", "b"))

    // asynchronous map
    |> TaskSeq.mapAsync (fun x -> task { return "hello: " + x })
    
    // asynchronous iter
    |> TaskSeq.iterAsync (fun data -> File.WriteAllTextAsync(fileName, data))


// infinite sequence
let feedFromTwitter user pwd = taskSeq {
    do! loginToTwitterAsync(user, pwd)
    while true do
       let! message = getNextNextTwitterMessageAsync()
       yield message
}
```

### `TaskSeq` module functions

We are working hard on getting a full set of module functions on `TaskSeq` that can be used with `IAsyncEnumerable` sequences. Our guide is the set of F# `Seq` functions in F# Core and, where applicable, the functions provided from `AsyncSeq`. Each implemented function is documented through XML doc comments to provide the necessary context-sensitive help.

The following is the progress report:

#### Note 1<!-- omit in toc -->

_These functions require a form of pre-materializing through `TaskSeq.cache`, similar to the approach taken in the corresponding `Seq` functions. It doesn't make much sense to have a cached async sequence. However, `AsyncSeq` does implement these, so we'll probably do so eventually as well._  

#### Note 2<!-- omit in toc -->

_Because of the async nature of `TaskSeq` sequences, iterating from the back would be bad practice. Instead, materialize the sequence to a list or array and then apply the `xxxBack` iterators._  

#### Note 3<!-- omit in toc -->

_The motivation for `readOnly` in `Seq` is that a cast from a mutable array or list to a `seq<_>` is valid and can be cast back, leading to a mutable sequence. Since `TaskSeq` doesn't implement `IEnumerable<_>`, such casts are not possible._

## More information

### Futher reading `IAsyncEnumerable`

- A good C#-based introduction [can be found in this blog][8].
- [An MSDN article][9] written shortly after it was introduced.
- Converting a `seq` to an `IAsyncEnumerable` [demo gist][10] as an example, though `TaskSeq` contains many more utility functions and uses a slightly different approach.
- If you're looking for using `IAsyncEnumerable` with `async` and not `task`, the excellent [`AsyncSeq`][11] library should be used. While `TaskSeq` is intended to consume `async` just like `task` does, it won't create an `AsyncSeq` type (at least not yet). If you want classic Async and parallelism, you should get this library instead.

### Futher reading on resumable state machines

- A state machine from a monadic perspective in F# [can be found here][12], which works with the pre-F# 6.0 non-resumable internals.
- The [original RFC for F# 6.0 on resumable state machines][13]
- The [original RFC for introducing `task`][14] to F# 6.0.
- A [pre F# 6.0 `TaskBuilder`][15] that motivated the `task` CE later added to F# Core.
- [MSDN Documentation on `task`][16] and [`async`][17].

### Further reading on computation expressions

- [Docs on MSDN][18] form a good summary and starting point.
- Arguably the best [step-by-step tutorial to using and building computation expressions][19] by Scott Wlaschin.
